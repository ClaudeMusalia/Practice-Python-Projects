Numpy VS Pandas

Both Pandas and NumPy are essential Python libraries for data analysis and numerical computing, but they serve different purposes:

NumPy
Purpose: Efficient numerical computation.
Data Structure: Primarily works with multi-dimensional arrays (ndarray).
Key Features: Fast operations for numerical data (matrix math, element-wise operations).
Best For: Handling numerical datasets, mathematical computations, or working with homogeneous data types.
Why Pick NumPy:
When you need speed for numerical tasks.
For scientific computing or creating custom data processing workflows.
Pandas
Purpose: Data manipulation and analysis.
Data Structure: Works with Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D tabular structure).
Key Features: Built-in methods for data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and merging.
Best For: Analyzing and manipulating structured/tabular datasets.
Why Pick Pandas:
When working with labeled or mixed data types.
For tasks involving cleaning, reshaping, or summarizing data.
Key Difference
NumPy: High performance for numerical computation but lacks advanced data manipulation tools.
Pandas: Versatile for structured data manipulation but slightly slower due to abstraction layers.
Use NumPy for raw computations and Pandas when your data has structure (like rows and columns).
